## About
You awake one, cold winters day, lying on the floor of the **clone** machine you built for the military. The usually busy lab is empty and the base deserted. You can hear growns in the distance... zombies!

### Zombies
They can smell you. They'll hunt you down wherever you are. You cannot hide! 

They'll start spawning once every 6 seconds (level 1), for ever 10 spawns 1/2 second is taken away until it reaching 1 second (level 10).

### Cloning
The cloning maching is still on and it has you're DNA on file. Every 30 seconds it'll produce a clone of you (maximum of 5 players at anyone time).

## Controls
* Select player (blue) by either clicking it or via the left hand menu.
* Point and click to where you want it to go.
* Movement can be queued up by clicking multiple locations.
* Ammo can be replenished in the armoury, marked by the box.
* Health can be restored by visiting the hospital, marked by the red cross.
* You can stop a player with the X by their name.

## Attacking
Your players will automatically fire bullets as zombies when in range, and melee them at close quarters.

## Known Issues
Some times the game will freeze. It's related to the route finding but I haven't managed to track it down.
